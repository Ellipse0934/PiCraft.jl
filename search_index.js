The main highlight of this language was turtle graphics. In turtle graphics we have a robot with a pen which draws on a canvas. We can control this turtle using a few commands. The main commands are :forward : move the turtle forward\nturn : turn the turtle\npenUp/penDown : activate/deactivate the turtle\'s penTo get a brief understanding of how this works head over here.While Turtle programming generally refers to a 2-D turtle we have a 3-D version available. In the 3-D version we have three types of turn available for each of the dimensions of the turtle.pitch\nyaw\nrollLet\'s first start with only operating on a 2-D plane and later we will discuss 3-D.You need to clear up space for experimentation. Use setBlocks() with PiCraft.AIR to clear up space.

Writing a program to build structures is a great way to minimize repetitive work while experimenting with different parameters. If you are making a small house odds are that writing a program is inefficient and manually building it will get the job done much faster. However, if you are trying to build a skyscraper which spawns 20 stories high then manually it could take several hours depending on your speed but it will definitely be very boring. Writing code to do the same will take a dozen minutes with the added advantage that making changes will be extremely easy.To get there first we will start small.

    "text": "If we want to consider a 3-D implementation of the Game of Life then we must realise that in 3-D a cell will have 26 Neighbours (3^3 - 1).We generally express a 3-D system as a Life wxyz system. The rules of such a system are :The number of live neighbours must be between w and x to sustain life.\nThe number of live neighbours must be between y and z to bring a dead back to life.Conway\'s Game of Life is hence a Life 2333 system. Since a large number of combinations are possible they have been studied extensively for their properties. Most systems quickly collapse or explode. Life 4555 and 5766 are the only valid systems which exhibit life like properties.Let\'s implement Life 4555. For that we will rewrite the nextState and displayState funcitons.function nextState(A::Array{Bool, 3})\n    B = similar(A)\n    dims = size(A)\n    for i = 1:dims[1], j = 1:dims[2], k = 1:dims[3]\n        liveNeighbours = 0\n        for p = -1:1, q = -1:1, r = -1:1\n            if checkbounds(Bool, A, i + p, j + q, k + r) && (p == 0 && q == 0 && r == 0)\n                liveNeighbours += 1\n            end\n        end\n        if A[i, j, k] == false && liveNeighbours == 5\n            B[i, j, k] = true\n        elseif liveNeighbours < 4 || liveNeighbours > 5\n            B[i, j, k] = false\n        end\n    end\n    return B\nend\n\nfunction displayState(p::Tuple{Int, Int, Int}, A::Array{Bool, 3})\n    dims = size(A)\n    for i = 1:dims[1], j = 1:dims[2], k = 1:dims[3]\n        if A[i, j, k]\n            setBlock(p .+ (i, j, k), Block(35))\n        else\n            setBlock(p .+ (i, j, k), Block(35, 15))\n        end\n    end\nend\n\np = getTile() .+ (3, 4, 3)\nA = rand(Bool, 7, 7, 7)\n\nfor i = 1:20\n    displayState(A)\n    A = nextState(A)\n    sleep(0.5)\nendThis page was generated using Literate.jl."

    "text": "In this example we will explore Platform 9 and three quarters of King\'s cross station, LondonAt the beginning of an academic year of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry a large number of students choose to travel using the Hogwards Express. The train departs from platform 9 and three quarters, King\'s Cross Station, London. To reach this platform wizards and witches must run into an arch between the platforms 9 and 10 to be teleported the 9Â¾ platform. However due a certain number of mishaps/accidents over the years the Ministry of Magic has made new rules.Only those heading into the wall at a predetermined speed of 4.3 m/s may be teleported. Too slow and the wizrd might be folling around and too fast might result in a minor injury or worse... Being spotted by a muggle which the ministry will then have obliviate. PS : The ministry has now enforced the metric system for all official work. Hence the speed is mentioned in meters per second.using PiCraftFirst let us make the platforms (Muggle and Wizard world) Let\'s first make the muggle platform (9 & 10) and then place a platform perpendicular to that beneathp = getTile()\nsetBlocks(p .+ (1, 0, 1), p .+ (12, 1, 40), Block(43, 5)) # Make a cobblestone platform\nsetBlocks(p .+ (5, 2, 1), p .+ (8, 12, 40), Block(45))    # For Brick archesNow we want to make arches in the brick column. For now semi-circular arches will do The equation for a general circle is x^2 + y^2 = r^2 where r is the radius So in general if we have a point: (a, b, c) and we wish to make a circle around it we might do something like this:- (Say in the x-y plane)for x = -r:sign(r):r, y = -r:sign(r):r\n    if x^2 + y^2 <= r^2\n        setBlock(p .+ (x, y, 0), Block(1,0))\n    end\nendHowever, since we have to make a semicircle we should only iterate y from 0 to rr = 9\nc1 = p .+ (5, 2, 11) # Center for 1st arch\nfor y = 0:r, z = -r:r\n    if y^2 + z^2 < r^2\n        setBlocks(c1 .+ (0, y, z), c1 .+ (3, y, z), Block(0))\n    end\nend\n\nc2 = p .+ (5, 2, 40 - 10)\nfor y = 0:r, z = -r:r\n    if y^2 + z^2 < r^2\n        setBlocks(c2 .+ (0, y, z), c2 .+ (3, y, z), Block(0))\n    end\nend(Image: Platform.gif)Now we must now choose a reasonable condition to teleport One way can be: If player velocity in z direction and position is encosed within x: p[1] + 5:8 , y: p[2] + 2, z: 20.3 then teleport to desired location.Now how do we calculate velocity ? Velocity is the rate at which an object\'s position changes w.r.t time. We can compute velocity as follows:p1 = getPos()\nsleep(0.05)\np2 = getPos()\nvel = (p2 - p1)./0.05 # velocity = distance/timeThis gives us the velocity component of each direction. To get the true instantaneous velocity we have to take the norm of this. v = norm([velocity...]) # We effectively does v = sqrt(vel_x^2 + vel_y^2 + vel_z^2) However we only care about a wizard\'s z-component of velocity which will be vel[3]function getVel()\n    p1 = getPos()\n    sleep(0.05)\n    vel = getPos() .- p1\n    return vel[3]/0.05\nend\n\nt = time()\nwhile time() - t < 10\n    post(\"Velocity = \"*string.(getVel())*\" m/s\")\nend(Image: getVel.png)Since platform 9Â¾ remains closed for most of the year we can add a time constraint to automatically close it.t = time()\npost(\"Platform 9Â¾ open!\")\nwhile time() - t < 30 # Platform closes in 30 seconds\n    v = getVel()\n    pos = getPos()\n    if v >= 4.20 && v <= 4.32\n        if pos[1] < p[1] + 9 && pos[1] > p[1] + 4 && pos[2] == p[2] + 2 && pos[3] > p[3] + 19.3\n            setPos(p)\n        end\n    end\nend\npost(\"Platform 9Â¾ closed!\")Now, We wish to make an identical copy of this planform.m = copyModel(p .+ (1, 0, 1), p .+ (12, 12, 40))\nbuildModel(rotate(m, dir = :l, dim = :y), p .+ (1, 15, 1))This built a copy of the platform which is perpendicular and above it. Place the new plaform anywhere you desire. Then set p to the coordinates of the arch.This page was generated using Literate.jl."
