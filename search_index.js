    "text": "Control a Minecraft world from JuliaMinecraft is one of the most popular video games in existence, with a player base of over 75 million users. While normally a game that is played with regular user controls, the Pi edition introduced a programatic API, that allows external programs to to control the Minecraft world. This api has been ported to the existing Java version of the game as well, using server plugins. Being able to control a physical 3D world from code creates many amazing opportunities for fun and education.This project provides a library that allows Julia programs to control a Minecraft world."

The main highlight of this language was turtle graphics. In turtle graphics we have a robot with a pen which draws on a canvas. We can control this turtle using a few commands. The main commands are :forward : move the turtle forward\nturn : turn the turtle\npenUp/penDown : activate/deactivate the turtle\'s penTo get a brief understanding of how _this_ works head over here.While Turtle programming generally refers to a 2-D turtle we have a 3-D version available. In the 3-D version we have three types of turn available for each of the dimensions of the turtle.pitch\nyaw\nrollLet\'s first start with only operating on a 2-D plane and later we will discuss 3-D.You need to clear up space for experimentation. Use setBlocks() with PiCraft.AIR to clear up space.

Writing a program to build structures is a great way to minimize repetitive work while experimenting with different parameters. If you are making a small house odds are that writing a program is inefficient and manually building it will get the job done much faster. However, if you are trying to build a skyscraper which spawns 20 stories high then manually it could take several hours depending on your speed but it will definitely be very boring. Writing code to do the same will take a dozen minutes with the added advantage that making changes will be extremely easy.To get there first we will start small. In this tutorial we will learn how to build a simple skyscraper.Our first task is to decide the dimensions and the parameters. Then think of a strategy/algorithm which will do the construction."
